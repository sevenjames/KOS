header program state is blanked at program end by kOS overwriting in that area.
this erases the final state which would be nice to see remain on screen.

"x.0" prints as "x". this makes display look jumpy.
any way to zero-pad before printing?

prep eta and burn eta times should be elapsed time since those points.
but since they are re-calculated using ship mass, they act wrong when burning fuel.
consider clamping at 0.

tset and burn_duration both use (nd:deltav:mag/max_acc).
currently this value is being calculated twice in main burn loop.
