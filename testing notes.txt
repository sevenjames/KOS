header program state is blanked at program end by kOS overwriting in that area.
this erases the final state which would be nice to see remain on screen.

"x.0" prints as "x". this makes display look jumpy.
any way to zero-pad before printing?

prep_eta and burn_eta are continuously calculated using ship.mass.
this makes them responsive to any changes in situation.
this makes them not accurately represent time.
they get weird during and after burn.
A
	assume situation wont change before node burn.
	use as is.
	clamp at 0 to prevent misinterpretation of wonk numbers.
B
	calulate them ONCE with ship.mass.
	convert to fixed time stamps.
	continuously subtract now() for actual time values
C
	trash some of these vars, some are not used for anything 

tset and burn_duration both use (nd:deltav:mag/max_acc).
currently this value is being calculated twice in main burn loop.
